This file is part of ongoing project. 
The project aimed to integrate the Topological Hybrid Analysis in MAPP tool.

Here we will just return the Hybrid Equation of a circuit modeled in MAPP. 
And the given equation we will try to solve in FPGA for real time simuation of big circuit. 
We will use modified conjugate gradient method to solve the set of equation.
